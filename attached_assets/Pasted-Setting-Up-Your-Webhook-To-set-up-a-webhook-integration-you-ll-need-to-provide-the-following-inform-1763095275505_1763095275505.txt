Setting Up Your Webhook
To set up a webhook integration, you'll need to provide the following information:

Integration Name: A unique name for your webhook integration (2-30 characters, no special characters).
Webhook Endpoint: The URL where you want to receive webhook events (must be a valid HTTPS URL).
Access Token: A secret key used to verify the authenticity of incoming webhook requests.
Implementing Webhook Secret Mechanism
To ensure the security of your webhook, we use a secret token to sign the payload. Here's how to verify incoming webhooks:

Example in Node.js:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// This should be securely stored, e.g., in environment variables
const ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_secure_access_token';

function validateAccessToken(req) {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  if (!authHeader || !authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
    return false;
  }
  const token = authHeader.split(" ")[1];
  return token === ACCESS_TOKEN;
}

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  if (!validateAccessToken(req)) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid access token' });
  }

  // Process the webhook payload here
  // ...

  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Webhook processed successfully' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Webhook server listening on port 3000'));
Publish Articles Event
When an article is published, we'll send a POST request to your webhook endpoint with a JSON payload. The payload will include:

event_type: The type of event that occurred ( always "publish_articles" in this case).
timestamp: The time the event occurred (ISO 8601 format).
data: An object containing event-specific data, including an array of affected articles.
Article Data Properties
Each article in the payload will contain the following properties:

id: Unique identifier for the article.
title: The title of the article.
content_markdown: The article content in Markdown format.
content_html: The article content in HTML format.
meta_description: A brief description of the article for SEO purposes.
created_at: The timestamp when the article was created (ISO 8601 format).
image_url: The URL of the main image associated with the article.
slug: The URL-friendly version of the article title used for permalinks.
tags: An array of tags associated with the article.
Example Payload:

  "timestamp": "2023-04-01T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {

      }
    ]
  }
}
Testing Your Webhook
Once you've set up your webhook integration, you can test it by publishing an article:

Navigate to any article page in your dashboard.
Click the "Publish" button to publish the article.
Your webhook endpoint should receive a POST request with the article data.
Check your server logs to verify the webhook was received and processed correctly.
If you don't receive the webhook, check your endpoint URL, access token configuration, and ensure your server is publicly accessible via HTTPS.
Best Practices
Always verify the webhook access token to ensure the request is genuine.
Implement proper error handling and logging in your webhook receiver.
Set up monitoring for your webhook endpoint to ensure it's always available.
Consider implementing a retry mechanism for failed webhook deliveries.
Troubleshooting
Webhook endpoint not receiving requests
Verify your endpoint URL is correct, publicly accessible, and using HTTPS. Check your server logs and firewall settings.

Access token validation failing
Ensure your access token matches exactly what you configured in the integration settings. Check for extra spaces or incorrect Bearer format.

Webhook returning 500 errors
Check your server logs for specific error details. Ensure your endpoint can handle JSON payloads and responds with appropriate status codes.

401/403 authentication errors on hosting platforms
If using platforms like Vercel, ensure your webhook endpoint doesn't require platform-specific authentication. Configure your routes to be publicly accessible for webhook requests.

Payload parsing errors
Ensure your endpoint accepts application/json content type and can parse the JSON payload structure correctly.
